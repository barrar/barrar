Product-minded full stack and DevOps engineer with 15 years of experience building scalable, reliable systems that are predictable, testable, observable and well-documented. I design resilient cloud architectures, deliver lasting performance gains, streamline CI/CD and dev workflows, integrate complex third-party platforms, and lead projects from concept to production. My approach pairs deep diagnostics with pragmatic engineering to eliminate bottlenecks, harden reliability, and control cost.
